Add Many Numbers
This Python project contains a function that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.

Features
The many_numbers function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of those numbers.

The program includes a main function to test the many_numbers function with a predefined list of numbers.

Functionality
many_numbers(numbers):

Takes a list of integers as input.

Returns the sum of those integers.

Code Explanation
many_numbers function:

It initializes a variable total_so_far to 0.

Loops through each number in the provided list and adds it to the total_so_far variable.

Finally, it returns the sum after the loop is complete.

main function:

Creates a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Calls the many_numbers function to get the sum.

Prints the result in a user-friendly message.

Example
Code:

def many_numbers(numbers) -> int:
    total_so_far = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total_so_far += number
    return total_so_far

def main():
    numbers: list[int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = many_numbers(numbers)
    print(f"The sum of {numbers} is {result}.")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Output:

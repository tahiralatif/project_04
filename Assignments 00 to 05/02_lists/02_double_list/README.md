# Double List Program

This program takes a list of numbers and doubles each element in the list.

## Problem Statement

We are given a list of integers. Our task is to double each element in the list and print the updated list.

For example, if we start with the following list:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The program will modify the list and output the following:

numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

## How It Works

1. The program defines a list of integers.
2. It iterates over each element in the list using a `for` loop.
3. For each element, it multiplies the element by 2.
4. The updated element is stored back into the list.
5. The modified element is printed immediately after being updated.

### Code:

```python
def main():
    # Initial list of numbers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Loop through each element in the list
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        elem_at_index = numbers[i] 
        # Double the element and update the list
        numbers[i] = elem_at_index * 2
        # Print the updated element
        print(numbers[i])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Output
The output will be:

Each element in the list is doubled and printed in the output.

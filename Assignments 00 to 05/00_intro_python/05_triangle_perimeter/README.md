# Triangle Perimeter Calculator

This Python program calculates the perimeter of a triangle based on user-provided side lengths.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to input the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
2. It calculates the perimeter by summing up the three side lengths.
3. The result is displayed in a formatted output.

## Usage

1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter the lengths of the three sides when prompted.

Example:
```
Enter the length of the first side: 3
Enter the length of the second side: 4
Enter the length of the third side: 5
3.0 + 4.0 + 5.0 = 12.0
The perimeter of the triangle is 12.0
```

## Requirements

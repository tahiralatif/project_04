# üßÆ How Old Are They?  

This Python program calculates and displays the ages of five individuals: Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, and Ethan, based on predefined relationships between their ages.

## üìñ How It Works  

The program defines the ages as follows:  
- **Anton** is 21 years old.  
- **Beth** is 6 years older than Anton.  
- **Chen** is 20 years older than Beth.  
- **Drew** is as old as Chen plus Anton's age.  
- **Ethan** is the same age as Chen.  

The user can input the name of a person (**Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, or Ethan**) to find out their age.
